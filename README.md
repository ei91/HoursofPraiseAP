# Hours of Praise App

The **Hours of Praise App** is an engaging, user-friendly Christian event-based mobile application built using Swift and SwiftUI. The app is designed to provide a seamless user experience for concert attendees, offering features such as event details, donation functionality, and multimedia content, including videos and daily Bible verses. The app was crafted with attention to both aesthetics and user engagement, ensuring that each section delivers a purpose-driven experience for users.

## Key Features

- **Splash Screen with Animation**: A custom splash screen that welcomes users to the app with smooth fade-in and scale animations.
- **Upcoming Events Section**: Displays upcoming concerts, providing detailed event information and a countdown timer for the next big event.
- **Video Playback**: Includes a video player to showcase the charity's impact or concert highlights, integrated with AVKit.
- **Daily Bible Verses**: Rotates between two daily Bible verses with their context and explanations to inspire and engage users.
- **Donation Section**: Users can make one-time or subscription-based donations directly from the app, supporting ongoing events and community outreach.
- **Archive**: Features a video archive where users can watch past events and relive key moments from previous Hours of Praise concerts.

## Technologies Used

- **SwiftUI**: Swift’s declarative framework for building interactive and engaging user interfaces.
- **AVKit**: For seamless video integration and playback within the app.
- **CoreData**: Utilized for persistent data storage, ensuring that event information and user data can be securely saved and accessed.
- **WebKit**: Integrated to support external content, such as YouTube videos, within the app’s archive section.

## Design and Architecture

The **Hours of Praise App** is structured for scalability and maintainability, ensuring that new features and sections can be easily added. Here's an overview of the app's design:

1. **Navigation**: A `TabView` provides a clear and easy way to navigate between key sections of the app.
2. **Accessibility**: The app adheres to accessibility standards, using legible fonts, color contrasts, and adaptable layouts that ensure all users can interact with the content.
3. **Responsive Design**: Thoughtfully designed for different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience across devices from iPhones to iPads.
4. **Code Quality**: Clean and readable code, written with best practices in mind for future collaboration and development.

## Future Features

- **Push Notifications**: Keep users informed of upcoming events or new content added to the app.
- **Social Media Integration**: Share upcoming events, Bible verses, and more directly to social media platforms.
- **Event Ticket Scanning**: Integrate barcode scanning to provide seamless event entry for concert attendees.

## Why This Project Stands Out

The **Hours of Praise App** demonstrates the ability to combine technical skill, user-focused design, and purposeful content to create a meaningful application. This project showcases:

- Full-stack mobile development capabilities using Swift and SwiftUI.
- Integration of multimedia elements (AVKit, WebKit) to create a rich user experience.
- Real-world application with features supporting charitable and community-driven causes.
